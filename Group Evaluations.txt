Allen Lam - Did everything on time, started things early, was pretty much the center of the team, everyone talked to him and he relayed it to the rest of the team.  
Dylan Nguyen - Also started pretty early, and communicated pretty well. 
Sai Padmanaban - Not very much contact, but he was assigned a part and he did it.
